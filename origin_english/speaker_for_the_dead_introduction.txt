Introduction                                                                                        Introducción

Speaker for the Dead is a sequel, but it didn't begin life that way--and you                        La Voz de los Muertos es una secuela, pero no comenzó de esta manera... Y no
don't have to read it that way, either. It was my intention all along for                           tiene que leerse de esa manera, tampoco. Fué mi intención todo el tiempo que La

Ender's Game or not. Indeed, in my mind this was the "real" book, if I hadn't                       hubiese leído el juego de Ender o no. De hecho, en mi mente éste fue el libro
been trying to write Speaker for the Dead back in 1983, there would never have                      "real", si no hubiera estado tratando de escribir La Voz de los Muertos allá en

How did Speaker for the Dead come to be? As with all my stories, this one began                     ¿Cómo fue que La Voz de los Muertos llegó a ser? Como en todas mis historias,
with more than one idea. The concept of a "speaker for the dead" arose from my                      ésta comenzó con mas de una idea. El concepto de una "Voz de los Muertos" salió

I rejected that idea I thought that a more appropriate funeral would be to say                      Rechazaba esa idea, pense que un funeral más apropiado sería decir honestamente,
honestly, what that person was and what that person did. But to me, "honesty"                       lo que fue una persona y lo que esa persona hizo. Pero para mi, "honestamente"
doesn't simply mean saying all the unpleasant things instead of saying only the                     no significa simplemente decir todas las cosas desfavorables en lugar de decir

But that was not the only source of Speaker for the Dead. I was also a longtime
aficionado of anthropological science fiction--stories in which a scientist
studies an alien culture and uncovers the reasons for their strangeness. The
first such novel that I read was James Blish's A Case of Conscience. Not many
years later, I read Michael Bishop's story "Death and Designation among the
Asadi." Both had a powerful effect on me.  So in the back of my mind, I had a
strong desire to add something of my own to that subgenre.

So when I thought of the idea of an alien species which in order to reproduce,
had to slaughter each other in terrible intertribal wars, it was only natural
that I decided the story should be told from the viewpoint of a human scientist
studying them. Only gradually, over several years. did I develop the idea of the
piggies and their strange lifecycle, and the intertribal war receded in
importance--so much so that I didn't need to make it an issue in Speaker for the
Dead at all. But it was in trying to think of an evolutionary reason why these
little porcine aliens would need to slaughter each other for the species to
thrive that I came up with the pequeninos that you meet in the pages of this
book.

I was living with my wife,  Kristine (née Allen), in Orem, Utah, when I made the
first breakthrough in creating this book.  The two ideas were still quite
separate, and the speaker-for-the-dead idea was still in a very primitive form.
In fact, I had decided that the funeral "oration" should be in song--that it
should be a "singer of death." I suppose I thought of this because I had sung at
a few funerals and found it a moving experience even when I didn't know the
deceased. But when I mentioned this singer-of-death idea to Kristine, she
winced. "You've already written 'Unaccompanied Sonata' and Songmaster." she
reminded me. "They were both about music. If you do another music story people
will think that's all you can do." I realized that she was even more right than
she knew! It happened that "Unaccompanied Sonata" and the original short story,
"Mikal's Songbird," on which Songmaster had been based were also two of my
stories that had been nominated for awards. In fact a novella called
"Songhouse," which was really the opening chapters of Songmaster, had also been
nominated for a Hugo. The only story of mine which had been nominated for awards
and that wasn't about music was the novelet version of "Ender's Game"! So
Kristine had inadvertently caught me in the unconscious process of imitating my
own past successes. I knew she was right--the music motif may have won me some
favorable attention, but it was time to set aside that crutch and do something
else.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So it would be a speaker of death in my story, not a singer. That felt right.
But here's the silly part. Perhaps I was still unconsciously trying to lean on
my most successful previous work, but I immediately wondered, What if the
Speaker of Death was Ender Wiggin? It was obvious to me what I was doing--if I
can't do the music thing, I can still bring the kid-who-saves-the-world back for
another round! And yet the idea appealed to me. I didn't trust it yet, but it
appealed to me.

After all, Ender had to do something after destroying the Buggers. What if Ender
Wiggin comes to an alien world as a Speaker of Death, and accidently gets caught
up in the mystery of why these piggies are slaughtering each other? It had a
delicious symmetry to it--the man who, as a child, destroyed one alien species
now has a chance to save another.

The idea sat there in the back of my mind for many months and as it did, the
story grew. More to the point. The character of Ender grew. I had never thought
much about what he would do after winning his war at the end of "Ender's Game",
except that his life would never be that interesting again, and he would have a
terrible time adjusting to normal human life. A, writer friend of mine, Jim
Tucker, had once proposed doing a sequel to "Ender's Game" that involved
bringing Ender back to Earth, but while the story he came up with had some
appeal, I knew in my heart ~ the one thing Ender could never do was return to
live out his life on the birthworld of humanity. Having him become a speaker for
the dead, however, wandering from nation to nation and world to world,
researching and orating for the dead—that, I thought, was a wonderful way to
reconcile him with the human race that had used him up as a child.

Gradually the ideas came together. When my agent, Barbara Bova, said that she'd
like to sell a book to Tom Doherty's new publishing house, Tor, I realized that
the book I wanted to write next was Speaker of Death. So I wrote an outline and
the first few chapters, the contract was written, the deal was made. I was
living in lndiana at the time, working on a doctorate at Notre Dame and
finishing up Hart's Hope, Worthing Chronicle and Saints for another publisher.
It wasn't until the recession interrupted my degree program (forever, I'm afraid
--no doctorate for me now!) and sent me to Greensboro, North Carolina, for my
only stint doing honest labor since 1978 that I had a chance to get back to
Speaker of Death.

What I discovered then--the spring of 1983--was that the book was unwritable. In order to make the Ender Wiggin of Speaker make any kind of sense, I had to have this really long, kind of boring opening chapter that brought him from the end of the Bugger War to the beginning of the story of Speaker some three thousand years later!  It was outrageous. I couldn't write it.

When Compute!, the publisher I was working for as a book editor, sent me along to the American Booksellers Association convention in Dallas, I noticed that Tom Doherty himself was at the Tor Books exhibit. I greeted him, and then on impulse asked him if I could talk to him. I had no well-formed plan in mind, and I was a little frightened when he said, "Sure," and set an appointment not long after.  Our meeting consisted of walking through the crowds as I explained to him the problem I was having writing Speaker.  The only solution I could think of, I said, was to write a novel version of Ender's Game, so I could put all that material about how Ender became a Speaker for the Dead at the end of that book, thus allowing Speaker to begin at its true beginning.

Once I proposed the idea  (having only thought of it a short while before) it seemed so obvious that I wondered why I       hadn't tried to sell a novel version of Ender's Game years before. (Only later did I realise that it wasn't until I was working on Speaker that the character of Ender Wiggin grew enough to be able to sustain a novel.) Still, Tom agreed with me that a novel version of Ender's Game was a good idea. "Let's do it" he said. "Same terms as Speaker?".

"Sure," I said, hardly believing that the decision could be made so easily--I hadn't talked to him more than five minutes.

"Fine.  We'll send a contract to Barbara as soon as I get back to New York."

Lo! It happened exactly as he said!  This was something I had never seen before--a publisher making a decision instantly and then having everything he said turn out to be true! I still marvel at it--a publisher who is not only an honest man but also loves (and reads) books, makes decisions quickly, and then can sell the books he publishes!

Gratefully I set aside Speaker and began plotting Ender's Game. By the time I quit my job at Compute! that fall, after only nine months in the position (I'm not cut out for corporate life anymore, I'm afraid), I was raring to go. I began Ender's Game before Christmas that year, took a break to go to Utah to promote my novel Saints, and then returned home and finished the book in a couple more weeks.

Then I turned to Speaker and the real suffering began.  By now, of course, the title had changed from Speaker of Death to Speaker for the Dead, as the concept had clarified at the end of Ender's Game. By now, the character of Ender had developed so much that my original draft of the opening of Speaker was almost laughable. I had begun (except for the "introductory chapter") with Ender's arrival on the planet Lusitania.  Just in time to speak the death of an old lout named Marcão.  But it was hollow and empty and it just wasn't working.  So I went back to the drawing board and began all over again.

I began the book several more times, each time getting a little farther, but each time being blocked because it still wasn't right. I didn't know what "right" was, of course--but I did have several hundred pages of "wrong." (During this struggle with Speaker I wrote the novel Wyrms, which in some ways was a tryout of the scientific ideas in Speaker and, eventually, Xenocide—using a semisentient molecule that adapts itself easily to alien species in order to take them over and control them.)

Finally I knew I had to begin with the character of Novinha, who hadn't even existed in the original outline.  And the characters of Pipo and Libo had also emerged, along with Pipo's death, pretty much as they happen in the first few chapters of the book you now hold in your hands. But I still wasn't done. It still wasn't enough. I was about 200 pages deep and the book was dead in my hands and I didn't know what to do.

It happened that a good friend of mine.  Gregg Keizer was working for Compute!  In fact I was the one who had recruited him away from his job as a junior high school English teacher (for which I think he has forgiven me) and brought him out to North Carolina. I had met Gregg when he became my student at a science fiction writing class I taught in the University of Utah's evening school program back in the seventies.  He was one of those frustrating students who are simply brilliant when they walk in the door, so the teacher can't take the slightest credit for anything they do.  He was also one of the most decent human beings I know, which makes me very nervous around him--so nervous, in fact that the only times I have ever gotten thoroughly and stupidly lost have been while he was in the car with me and I was supposed to know where I was going.  Some teacher!

(I once was so certain that a story of Gregg's would sell that I made a wager with my class--if it didn't sell within one year, I would run naked through the corridors of Orson Spencer Hall on the U of U campus, which is where our class met. The story didn't sell in a year--a pox on editors!--and, perhaps out of an exaggerated commitment to aesthetics, I reneged on the bet. Since the story did sell a short while afterward, Gregg has never demanded that I make good, but he does have the debt hanging over my head.)

Anyway, right during the time that I was stymied on Speaker, Gregg and I decided to go to New York for the 1985 Nebula weekend.  Ender's Game had only-just been published and neither of us had anything on the ballot. We just wanted to go to New York and to the Nebulas, so why not? I brought along the manuscript of Speaker for him to read--or perhaps I gave it to him in advance--I don't remember now. I do remember, though, sitting at the foot of his bed while he lay there and explained the problems he saw in Speaker.

He had many  good ideas. Of course, most of them dealt with small fixes for problems in the manuscript as it now stood.  One comment he made, however, illuminated everything for me.  "I couldn't tell Novinha's kids apart," he said.  "I couldn't remember which was which."

I had enough experience by then to know exactly what this meant.  He couldn't tell Novinha's kids apart because they weren't characters. They were nothing but placeholders. At first I toyed with the idea of simply cutting them out. In my novel Saints, I had run into a problem with a younger sister of my protagonist--I kept forgetting she existed and completely neglecting her for hundreds of pages at a time. The solution was to eliminate the character; callously, I had her die in infancy.  But excision wasn't the right move in this case. Because I wanted Novinha to be voluntarily isolated, I had to have her be otherwise acceptable to her neighbors.  In a Catholic colony like Lusitania this meant Novinha needed to have a bunch of kids.

Yet I had no idea who they were or what they would do in the story.  Once you've read Speaker, of course, you'll wonder what the story would be without Novinha's children, and the answer is, It wouldn't be much!  But at the time I hadn't developed their role in the story; yet there was something in the story that led Gregg to want them to amount to something more--that made him want to be able to tell them apart.

It meant throwing out all but the first couple of chapters of what I had written so far (and, in fact, I ended up completely writing the novel from the beginning), but it soon dawned on me that it was worth doing, for this was the final idea, the one that would pull me through the whole book. I had observed before that one thing wrong with science fiction as a whole was that almost all the heroes seemed to spring fully-grown from the head of Zeus--no one had families.  If there was a mention of parents at all, it was to tell us they were dead, or such miserable specimens of humanity that the hero could hardly wait to get out of town.

Not only did they have no parents, few science fiction heroes seemed to marry and have kids. In short, the heroes of most science fiction novels were perpetual adolescents, lone rangers who wandered the universe avoiding commitments.  This shouldn't be surprising.  The romantic hero is invariably one who is going through the adolescent phase of human life.  The child phase--the one I had dealt with most often in my fiction--is the time of complete dependence on others to create our identity and our worldview.  Little children gladly accept even the strangest stories that others tell them, because they lack either the context or the confidence to doubt.  They go along because they don't know how to be alone, either physically or intellectually.

Gradually, however, this dependency breaks down--and children catch the first glimmers of a world that is different from the one they thought they lived in, they break away the last vestiges of adult control themselves, much as a baby bird breaks free of the last fragments of the egg.  The romantic hero is unconnected.  He belongs to no community; he is wandering from place to place, doing good (as he sees it), but then moving on. This is the life of the adolescent, full of passion, intensity, magic, and infinite possibility; but lacking responsibility, rarely expecting to have to stay and bear the consequences of error.  Everything is played at twice the speed and twice the volume in the adolescent--the romantic--life.

Only when the loneliness becomes unbearable do adolescents root themselves, or try to root themselves.  It may or may not be in the community of their childhood, and it may or may not be their childhood identity and connections that they resume upon entering adulthood.  And, in fact, many fail at adulthood and constantly reach backward for the freedom and passion of adolescence.  But those who achieve it are the ones who create civilization.

Most science fiction dealt with adolescent heroes, yes--but only because most fiction deals with adolescents.  This is not to say that fiction about adolescents is necessarily adolescent fiction, either in the sense of being for an adolescent audience or in the sense of being undeveloped or immature fiction.  Still, most storytellers invent their fables about the lives of footloose heroes--or heroes who become footloose for the sake of the story.  Who but the adolescent is free to have the adventures that most of us are looking for when we turn to storytellers to satisfy our hunger?

And yet to me, at least, the most important stories are the ones that teach us how to be civilized: the stories about children and adults, about responsibility and dependency.  Not being an adult myself, I had concentrated for many years on the child's point of view, but with Speaker for the Dead I was old enough, and perhaps (finally) civilized enough, to create the small community of the family from an adult perspective--not necessarily the parent's viewpoint, but rather the viewpoint of an adult who felt responsibility toward the family.  That adult would be Ender, I knew; and the children would be formed into a family that was suffering, as a whole and individually.  Thus I came to regard Speaker for the Dead as a perfect opportunity to show something only rarely seen in this genre of stories about the strange and wonderful: I could show the miracle of a family in transformation.

With this decision, of course, the focus changed.  The novel was no longer exclusively about the mystery of the alien pequeninos.  It was now at least as much about the redemption of Novinha's family, the healing of their injured little community.  More than that, it was about the idea of community itself--the community of Milagre, the community of the tribe of pequeninos.

This was not easy.  Most novels get by with showing the relationships between two or, at the most, three characters.  This is because the difficulty of creating a character increases with each new major character that is added to the tale.  Characters, as most writers understand, are truly developed through their relationships with others.  If there are only two significant characters, then there is only one relationship to be explored.  If there are three characters, however. there are four relationships: Between A and B, between B and C, between C and A, and finally the relationship when all three are together.

Even this does not begin to explain the complexity--for in real life, at least, most people change, at least subtly, when they are with different people. The changes can be pretty major--I remember well my summer as a performer at the Sundance Summer Theatre in Utah. I was a 19-year-old trying to convince myself and others that I was a man, so with the other performers I became at least as profane--nay, foul-mouthed and filthy-minded--as the most immature of them. I worked hard to develop some fluidity and cleverness in my vulgarity, and won my share of laughs from the others.  Yet during this whole time I lived with my parents, coming down the mountain at insane speeds late at night, only to end up in a home where certain words were simply never said.  And I never said them.  Not once did I slip and speak in front of my family the way I spoke constantly in front of the other performers at Sundance.  This was not by any herculean effort, either. I didn't think about changing my behavior; it simply happened.  When I was with my parents I wasn't the same person.

I have seen this time and time again with my friends, with other family members.  Our whole demeanor changes, our mannerisms, our figures of speech, when we move from one context to another.  Listen to someone you know when they pick up the telephone.  We have special voices for different people; our attitudes, our moods change depending on whom we are with.

So when a storyteller has to create three characters, each different relationship requires that each character in it must be transformed, however subtly, depending on how the relationship is shaping his or her present identity.  Thus, in a three-character story, a storyteller who wishes to convince us of the reality of these characters really has to come up with a dozen different personas, four for each of them.

What happens, then, when you start with a family with a mother, a dead father, and six troubled children, and then add a stranger who intrudes into the family and transforms every one of them?  It seemed to me like a sisyphean task, for I had to develop (or at least imply) dozens of personas, including the persona they had developed in order to deal with their dead father, and then show, clearly, how they all changed because of Ender's influence on their lives.

Much of that, however, would have to come with the actual writing of the new draft of the novel.  My immediate task was to differentiate clearly between Novinha's children when the reader first encounters them. I sat there in the room I shared with Gregg, assigning some immediate and obvious trait to each of the children that would help the reader keep track of them.  Oh, yes, Olhado is the one with the metal eyes; Quara is the one who says outrageous things after long silences; Grego is the violent one; Quim is the religious fanatic; Ela is the weary mother-figure; Miro is the eldest son, the hero in the others' eyes.  These "hooks" could only serve to introduce the children--I'd have to develop them far beyond that point--but having found those hooks, I had a plan that would let me proceed with confidence.

My novel had, at last, opened up to me, and I came home from that Nebula weekend and wrote the whole novel, from beginning to end, in a month.  As I tell my writing students, once you get the beginning right, the ending almost writes itself.

One more thing, though.  No matter how well-planned a novel is--and, in my case at least, it must be very well-planned before i can write it--there are still things that come up during the process of writing that you simply didn't plan on.  In my Alvin Maker novels, for instance, the characters of Little Peggy and Arthur Stuart weren't in any of my outlines, and yet they are now at the heart of that story.  And in Speaker for the Dead, the character of Jane wasn't in any of the outlines I made.  Oh, yes, I gave him a computer connection through the jewel in his ear, but I didn't know it was a person. Jane just grew because it was so fun to write her relationship with Ender.  She helped bring him to life (he could so easily have been a stodgy, dull adult), and in the process came to life herself.  By the time I was done with Speaker for the Dead, Jane was one of the most important characters in it, and much of the third book, Xenocide, centers around her.

Oh yes.  The third book. I had never planned to write a third book.  In fact, I really hadn't planned to write a first book--Speaker was originally supposed to be a solo.  But just as I was writing the last few chapters of Speaker, Barbara Bova called and said she had sold the Ender trilogy to an English publisher.

"The Ender trilogy," I asked.  "Barbara, there are only two."

Naturally, she was a bit flummoxed.  Of course she could always go back and renegotiate for only two books.  But first, couldn't I think a little bit and see if perhaps I might come up with a third story that I wanted to write?

At that moment I knew exactly the story I wanted to tell.  It had nothing to do with Ender Wiggin or any of the characters in Speaker for the Dead.  Rather it was an ancient project from early in my career, one that Jim Frenkel, then at Dell, had rejected because I just wasn't  mature enough, as a writer, to handle a project so difficult.  Having solved the problems of Speaker for the Dead, though, I felt ready to tackle anything.  It had been years since I had even thought about that story, then called Philotes, yet wasn't it possible that by putting Ender Wiggin into it, I might be able to bring it to life the way Speaker had come to life because of his presence? I might fail, of course, but why not try?

Besides--and here you are about to learn something truly vile about me--having a third book would mean that I didn't have to figure out some way to resolve the two loose threads that I knew would be dangling at the end of Speaker.  What happens to the hive queen?  And what happens to the fleet that Starways Congress sends?

By agreeing to do a third Ender book I could leave those questions for the sequel, and since I am a shamefully lazy man, I jumped at the chance. I jumped too soon--the book was every bit as difficult as Jim Frenkel had told me it would be, and it took years to get it right--and even then it is far and away the talkiest, most philosophical of my novels, which is just what the original outline of Philotes had required.  Over the years the title of the third book changed, from Ender's Children to Xenocide, and it also grew until it became two books, so that even Xenocide doesn't finish the story (though the next one will, I swear it!).

And, like Speaker for the Dead before it, Xenocide was the hardest book I'd ever written up to then.  You see, the work of a storyteller doesn't get any easier the more experience we get, because once we've learned how to do something, we can't get excited about doing exactly the same thing again--or at least most of us can't.  We keep wanting to reach for the story that is too hard for us to tell--and then make ourselves learn how to tell it.  If we succeed, then maybe we can write better and better books, or at least more challenging ones, or at the very least we won't bore ourselves.

The danger that keeps me just a little frightened with every book I write, however, is that I'll overreach myself once too often and try to write a story that I'm just plain not talented or skilled enough to write.  That's the dilemma every storyteller faces.  It is painful to fail.  But it is far sadder when a storyteller stops wanting to try.

Now I fear that I've told you more than you ever wanted to know about how Speaker for the Dead came to be.  A writer's life is boring indeed. I write stories about people who take risks, who reach out and change the world.  But when it comes to my life, it mostly consists of hanging around at home, writing when I have to, playing computer games or watching TV whenever I can get away with it.  My real life is being with my wife, with my children; going to church and teaching my Sunday school class; keeping in touch with my family and friends; and, the primary duty of every father, turning off lights throughout the house and muttering about how I'm the only one who seems to care about turning them off because I'm the one who has to change the lousy light bulbs. I doubt that there's much of a story in that.

But I hope that in the lives of Ender Wiggin, Novinha, Miro, Ela, Human, Jane, the hive queen, and so many others in this book, you will find stories worth holding in your memory, perhaps even in your heart.  That's the transaction that counts more than bestseller lists, royalty statements, awards, or reviews.  Because in the pages of this book, you and I will meet one-on-one, my mind and yours, and you will enter a world of my making and dwell there, not as a character that I control, but as a person with a mind of your own.  You will make of my story what you need it to be, if you can. I hope my tale is true enough and flexible enough that you can make it into a world worth living in.
