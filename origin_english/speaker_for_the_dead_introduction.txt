Speaker for the Dead is a sequel, but it didn't begin life that way--and you                        La Voz de los Muertos es una secuela, pero no comenzó de esta manera... Y no
don't have to read it that way, either. It was my intention all along for                           tiene que leerse de esa manera, tampoco. Fue mi intención todo el tiempo que La
Speaker to be able to stand alone, for it to make sense whether you have read                       Voz fuera capaz de ser independiente, para si misma tener sentido sea que ya se
Ender's Game or not. Indeed, in my mind this was the "real" book, if I hadn't                       hubiese leído el juego de Ender o no. De hecho, en mi mente éste fue el libro
been trying to write Speaker for the Dead back in 1983, there would never have                      "real", si no hubiera estado tratando de escribir La Voz de los Muertos allá en
been a novel version of Ender's Game at all.                                                        1983, nunca habría habido una versión en novela del Juego de Ender.

How did Speaker for the Dead come to be? As with all my stories, this one began                     ¿Cómo fue que La Voz de los Muertos llegó a ser? Como en todas mis historias,
with more than one idea. The concept of a "speaker for the dead" arose from my                      ésta comenzó con mas de una idea. El concepto de una "Voz de los Muertos" salió
experiences with death and funerals. I have written of this at greater length                       de mis experiencias con la muerte y funerales. He escrito al respecto con más
elsewhere; suffice it to say that I grew dissatisfied with the way that we use                      detalle en otras partes; baste decir que crecí insatisfecho con la manera en la
our funerals to revise the life of the dead, to give the dead a story so                            que usamos nuestros funerales para revisar la vida de los muertos, para darles
different from their, actual life that, in effect, we kill them all over again.                     una historia tan diferente de su, vida real que, en efecto, los asesinamos una
No, that is too strong. Let me just say that we erase them, we edit them, we                        vez mas. No, eso es muy fuerte. Permítanme decir solo que los borramos, los
make them into a person much easier to live with than the person who actually                       editamos, los hacemos una persona con quien sea mucho más facil vivir que la que
lived.                                                                                              en realidad vivió.

I rejected that idea I thought that a more appropriate funeral would be to say                      Rechazaba esa idea, pense que un funeral más apropiado sería decir honestamente,
honestly, what that person was and what that person did. But to me, "honesty"                       lo que fue una persona y lo que esa persona hizo. Pero para mi, "honestamente"
doesn't simply mean saying all the unpleasant things instead of saying only the                     no significa simplemente decir todas las cosas desfavorables en lugar de decir
nice ones. It doesn't even consist of averaging them out. No, to understand who                     sólo las buenas. Ni siquiera consiste en ponderarlas. No, entender quién fue en
a person really was, what his or her life really meant, the speaker for the dead                    realidad una persona, lo que su vida realmente significó, la voz de los muertos
would have to explain their self-story--what they meant to do, what they                            tendría que explicar su propia historia... lo que intentaban hacer, lo que en
actually did, what they regretted, what they rejoiced in. That's the story that                     verdad hicieron, de lo que se arrepintieron, de lo que se regocijaron. Ésa es la
we never know, the story that we never can know--and yet, at the time of death,                     historia que nunca conocemos, la historia que nunca podemos conocer... y aún, en
it's the only story truly worth telling.                                                            el momento de la muerte, la única historia que vale la pena contar.

I have received several letters, by the way, from people who are called upon to                     Por cierto, he recibido varias cartas, de gente que es llamada a hablar a veces
speak at funerals from time to time, and who, having read Speaker for the Dead,                     en funerales, y quienes, habiendo leído La Voz de los Muertos, se esfuerzan en
make an effort to turn the funeral service into a Speaking. I hasten to add that                    convertir el servicio funerario en una Plática. Me adelanto a agregar que lo han
they have done this either with the permission of the family or at the urging of                    hecho ya sea con el permiso de la familia o por impulso del fallecido (dado,
the deceased (given, obviously, before death!). Some of them have even sent me                      obviamente, ¡antes de su muerte!) Algunas de ellas me han incluso enviado el
the text of their Speaking, and I must tell you that the stories thus told are                      texto de su Plática, y debo decir que las historias así contadas son asombrosas
astonishing and powerful. I hope someone will do a Speaking at my funeral. I                        y poderosas. Espero alguien realize una Plática en mi funeral. Creo realmente
think there really is power and truth in the idea.                                                  hay poder y verdad en la idea.

But that was not the only source of Speaker for the Dead. I was also a longtime                     Pero esa no fue la única fuente para La Voz de los Muertos. Por largo tiempo fui
aficionado of anthropological science fiction--stories in which a scientist                         también aficionado a la ciencia-ficción antropológica... historias en las que un

years later, I read Michael Bishop's story "Death and Designation among the                         muchos años después, leí la historia de Michael Bishop "Muerte y Dominación

So when I thought of the idea of an alien species which in order to reproduce,                      Entonces cuando pensé en la idea de una especie alienígena que para reproducirse

order to make the Ender Wiggin of Speaker make any kind of sense, I had to have                     escribirse. Para que el Ender Wiggin de La Voz tuviera algo de sentido, tendría

Once I proposed the idea (having only thought of it a short while before) it                        Una vez que propuse la idea (habiéndola pensado sólo un poco antes de esto) me
seemed so obvious that I wondered why I hadn't tried to sell a novel version of                     parecía tan obvia que me preguntaba por qué no había tratado de vender el Juego

hadn't talked to him more than five minutes.                                                        No había platicado con él mas de cinco minutos.

"Fine. We'll send a contract to Barbara as soon as I get back to New York."                         "Bien. Mandaremos el contrato a Barbara tan pronto regrese a Nueva York."

Lo! It happened exactly as he said! This was something I had never seen before--                    ¡Y pasó exactamente como él dijo! Era algo que nunca había visto... ¡A un

Gratefully I set aside Speaker and began plotting Ender's Game. By the time I                       Agradecido, puse La Voz a un lado y comencé a plantear el Juego de Ender. Para

Then I turned to Speaker and the real suffering began. By now, of course, the                       Entonces regresé a La Voz y el sufrimiento real comenzó. Para entonces, claro,

I began the book several more times, each time getting a little farther, but                        Comencé el libro varias veces mas, en cada ocasión yendo un poco más lejos, pero

Finally I knew I had to begin with the character of Novinha, who hadn't even
existed in the original outline. And the characters of Pipo and Libo had also
emerged, along with Pipo's death, pretty much as they happen in the first few
chapters of the book you now hold in your hands. But I still wasn't done. It
still wasn't enough. I was about 200 pages deep and the book was dead in my
hands and I didn't know what to do.

It happened that a good friend of mine. Gregg Keizer was working for Compute! In
fact I was the one who had recruited him away from his job as a junior high
school English teacher (for which I think he has forgiven me) and brought him
out to North Carolina. I had met Gregg when he became my student at a science
fiction writing class I taught in the University of Utah's evening school
program back in the seventies. He was one of those frustrating students who are
simply brilliant when they walk in the door, so the teacher can't take the
slightest credit for anything they do. He was also one of the most decent human
beings I know, which makes me very nervous around him--so nervous, in fact that
the only times I have ever gotten thoroughly and stupidly lost have been while
he was in the car with me and I was supposed to know where I was going. Some
teacher!

(I once was so certain that a story of Gregg's would sell that I made a wager
with my class--if it didn't sell within one year, I would run naked through the
corridors of Orson Spencer Hall on the U of U campus, which is where our class
met. The story didn't sell in a year--a pox on editors!--and, perhaps out of an
exaggerated commitment to aesthetics, I reneged on the bet. Since the story did
sell a short while afterward, Gregg has never demanded that I make good, but he
does have the debt hanging over my head.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyway, right during the time that I was stymied on Speaker, Gregg and I decided
to go to New York for the 1985 Nebula weekend. Ender's Game had only-just been
published and neither of us had anything on the ballot. We just wanted to go to
New York and to the Nebulas, so why not? I brought along the manuscript of
Speaker for him to read--or perhaps I gave it to him in advance--I don't
remember now. I do remember, though, sitting at the foot of his bed while he lay
there and explained the problems he saw in Speaker.

He had many  good ideas. Of course, most of them dealt with small fixes for
problems in the manuscript as it now stood. One comment he made, however,
illuminated everything for me. "I couldn't tell Novinha's kids apart," he said.
"I couldn't remember which was which."

I had enough experience by then to know exactly what this meant. He couldn't
tell Novinha's kids apart because they weren't characters. They were nothing but
placeholders. At first I toyed with the idea of simply cutting them out. In my
novel Saints, I had run into a problem with a younger sister of my protagonist--
I kept forgetting she existed and completely neglecting her for hundreds of
pages at a time. The solution was to eliminate the character; callously, I had
her die in infancy. But excision wasn't the right move in this case. Because I
wanted Novinha to be voluntarily isolated, I had to have her be otherwise
acceptable to her neighbors. In a Catholic colony like Lusitania this meant
Novinha needed to have a bunch of kids.

Yet I had no idea who they were or what they would do in the story. Once you've
read Speaker, of course, you'll wonder what the story would be without Novinha's
children, and the answer is, It wouldn't be much! But at the time I hadn't
developed their role in the story; yet there was something in the story that led
Gregg to want them to amount to something more--that made him want to be able to
tell them apart.

It meant throwing out all but the first couple of chapters of what I had written
so far (and, in fact, I ended up completely writing the novel from the
beginning), but it soon dawned on me that it was worth doing, for this was the
final idea, the one that would pull me through the whole book. I had observed
before that one thing wrong with science fiction as a whole was that almost all
the heroes seemed to spring fully-grown from the head of Zeus--no one had
families. If there was a mention of parents at all, it was to tell us they were
dead, or such miserable specimens of humanity that the hero could hardly wait to
get out of town.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not only did they have no parents, few science fiction heroes seemed to marry
and have kids. In short, the heroes of most science fiction novels were
perpetual adolescents, lone rangers who wandered the universe avoiding
commitments. This shouldn't be surprising. The romantic hero is invariably one
who is going through the adolescent phase of human life. The child phase--the
one I had dealt with most often in my fiction--is the time of complete
dependence on others to create our identity and our worldview. Little children
gladly accept even the strangest stories that others tell them, because they
lack either the context or the confidence to doubt. They go along because they
don't know how to be alone, either physically or intellectually.

Gradually, however, this dependency breaks down--and children catch the first
glimmers of a world that is different from the one they thought they lived in,
they break away the last vestiges of adult control themselves, much as a baby
bird breaks free of the last fragments of the egg. The romantic hero is
unconnected. He belongs to no community; he is wandering from place to place,
doing good (as he sees it), but then moving on. This is the life of the
adolescent, full of passion, intensity, magic, and infinite possibility; but
lacking responsibility, rarely expecting to have to stay and bear the
consequences of error. Everything is played at twice the speed and twice the
volume in the adolescent--the romantic--life.

Only when the loneliness becomes unbearable do adolescents root themselves, or
try to root themselves. It may or may not be in the community of their
childhood, and it may or may not be their childhood identity and connections
that they resume upon entering adulthood. And, in fact, many fail at adulthood
and constantly reach backward for the freedom and passion of adolescence. But
those who achieve it are the ones who create civilization.

Most science fiction dealt with adolescent heroes, yes--but only because most
fiction deals with adolescents. This is not to say that fiction about
adolescents is necessarily adolescent fiction, either in the sense of being for
an adolescent audience or in the sense of being undeveloped or immature fiction.
Still, most storytellers invent their fables about the lives of footloose
heroes--or heroes who become footloose for the sake of the story. Who but the
adolescent is free to have the adventures that most of us are looking for when
we turn to storytellers to satisfy our hunger?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And yet to me, at least, the most important stories are the ones that teach us
how to be civilized: the stories about children and adults, about responsibility
and dependency. Not being an adult myself, I had concentrated for many years on
the child's point of view, but with Speaker for the Dead I was old enough, and
perhaps (finally) civilized enough, to create the small community of the family
from an adult perspective--not necessarily the parent's viewpoint, but rather
the viewpoint of an adult who felt responsibility toward the family. That adult
would be Ender, I knew; and the children would be formed into a family that was
suffering, as a whole and individually. Thus I came to regard Speaker for the
Dead as a perfect opportunity to show something only rarely seen in this genre
of stories about the strange and wonderful: I could show the miracle of a family
in transformation.

With this decision, of course, the focus changed. The novel was no longer
exclusively about the mystery of the alien pequeninos. It was now at least as
much about the redemption of Novinha's family, the healing of their injured
little community. More than that, it was about the idea of community itself--the
community of Milagre, the community of the tribe of pequeninos.

This was not easy. Most novels get by with showing the relationships between two
or, at the most, three characters. This is because the difficulty of creating a
character increases with each new major character that is added to the tale.
Characters, as most writers understand, are truly developed through their
relationships with others. If there are only two significant characters, then
there is only one relationship to be explored. If there are three characters,
however, there are four relationships: Between A and B, between B and C, between
C and A, and finally the relationship when all three are together.

Even this does not begin to explain the complexity--for in real life, at least,
most people change, at least subtly, when they are with different people. The
changes can be pretty major--I remember well my summer as a performer at the
Sundance Summer Theatre in Utah. I was a 19-year-old trying to convince myself
and others that I was a man, so with the other performers I became at least as
profane--nay, foul-mouthed and filthy-minded--as the most immature of them. I
worked hard to develop some fluidity and cleverness in my vulgarity, and won my
share of laughs from the others. Yet during this whole time I lived with my
parents, coming down the mountain at insane speeds late at night, only to end up
in a home where certain words were simply never said. And I never said them. Not
once did I slip and speak in front of my family the way I spoke constantly in
front of the other performers at Sundance. This was not by any herculean effort,
either. I didn't think about changing my behavior; it simply happened. When I
was with my parents I wasn't the same person.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have seen this time and time again with my friends, with other family members.
Our whole demeanor changes, our mannerisms, our figures of speech, when we move
from one context to another. Listen to someone you know when they pick up the
telephone. We have special voices for different people; our attitudes, our moods
change depending on whom we are with.

So when a storyteller has to create three characters, each different
relationship requires that each character in it must be transformed, however
subtly, depending on how the relationship is shaping his or her present
identity. Thus, in a three-character story, a storyteller who wishes to convince
us of the reality of these characters really has to come up with a dozen
different personas, four for each of them.

What happens, then, when you start with a family with a mother, a dead father,
and six troubled children, and then add a stranger who intrudes into the family
and transforms every one of them? It seemed to me like a sisyphean task, for I
had to develop (or at least imply) dozens of personas, including the persona
they had developed in order to deal with their dead father, and then show,
clearly, how they all changed because of Ender's influence on their lives.

Much of that, however, would have to come with the actual writing of the new
draft of the novel. My immediate task was to differentiate clearly between
Novinha's children when the reader first encounters them. I sat there in the
room I shared with Gregg, assigning some immediate and obvious trait to each of
the children that would help the reader keep track of them. Oh, yes, Olhado is
the one with the metal eyes; Quara is the one who says outrageous things after
long silences; Grego is the violent one; Quim is the religious fanatic; Ela is
the weary mother-figure; Miro is the eldest son, the hero in the others' eyes.
These "hooks" could only serve to introduce the children--I'd have to develop
them far beyond that point--but having found those hooks, I had a plan that
would let me proceed with confidence.

My novel had, at last, opened up to me, and I came home from that Nebula weekend
and wrote the whole novel, from beginning to end, in a month. As I tell my
writing students, once you get the beginning right, the ending almost writes
itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have seen this time and time again with my friends, with other family members.
One more thing, though. No matter how well-planned a novel is--and, in my case
at least, it must be very well-planned before i can write it--there are still
things that come up during the process of writing that you simply didn't plan
on. In my Alvin Maker novels, for instance, the characters of Little Peggy and
Arthur Stuart weren't in any of my outlines, and yet they are now at the heart
of that story. And in Speaker for the Dead, the character of Jane wasn't in
any of the outlines I made. Oh, yes, I gave him a computer connection through
the jewel in his ear, but I didn't know it was a person. Jane just grew because
it was so fun to write her relationship with Ender. She helped bring him to life
(he could so easily have been a stodgy, dull adult), and in the process came to
life herself. By the time I was done with Speaker for the Dead, Jane was one of
the most important characters in it, and much of the third book, Xenocide,
centers around her.

Oh yes. The third book. I had never planned to write a third book. In fact, I
really hadn't planned to write a first book--Speaker was originally supposed to
be a solo. But just as I was writing the last few chapters of Speaker, Barbara
Bova called and said she had sold the Ender trilogy to an English publisher.

"The Ender trilogy," I asked. "Barbara, there are only two."

Naturally, she was a bit flummoxed. Of course she could always go back and
renegotiate for only two books. But first, couldn't I think a little bit and see
if perhaps I might come up with a third story that I wanted to write?

At that moment I knew exactly the story I wanted to tell. It had nothing to do
with Ender Wiggin or any of the characters in Speaker for the Dead. Rather it
was an ancient project from early in my career, one that Jim Frenkel, then at
Dell, had rejected because I just wasn't mature enough, as a writer, to handle
a project so difficult. Having solved the problems of Speaker for the Dead,
though, I felt ready to tackle anything. It had been years since I had even
thought about that story, then called Philotes, yet wasn't it possible that by
putting Ender Wiggin into it, I might be able to bring it to life the way
Speaker had come to life because of his presence? I might fail, of course, but
why not try?

Besides--and here you are about to learn something truly vile about me--having a
third book would mean that I didn't have to figure out some way to resolve the
two loose threads that I knew would be dangling at the end of Speaker. What
happens to the hive queen? And what happens to the fleet that Starways Congress
sends?

By agreeing to do a third Ender book I could leave those questions for the
sequel, and since I am a shamefully lazy man, I jumped at the chance. I jumped
too soon--the book was every bit as difficult as Jim Frenkel had told me it
would be, and it took years to get it right--and even then it is far and away
the talkiest, most philosophical of my novels, which is just what the original
outline of Philotes had required. Over the years the title of the third book
changed, from Ender's Children to Xenocide, and it also grew until it became two
books, so that even Xenocide doesn't finish the story (though the next one will,
I swear it!).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And, like Speaker for the Dead before it, Xenocide was the hardest book I'd ever
written up to then. You see, the work of a storyteller doesn't get any easier
the more experience we get, because once we've learned how to do something, we
can't get excited about doing exactly the same thing again--or at least most of
us can't. We keep wanting to reach for the story that is too hard for us to
tell--and then make ourselves learn how to tell it.  If we succeed, then maybe
we can write better and better books, or at least more challenging ones, or at
the very least we won't bore ourselves.

The danger that keeps me just a little frightened with every book I write,
however, is that I'll overreach myself once too often and try to write a story
that I'm just plain not talented or skilled enough to write.  That's the dilemma
every storyteller faces. It is painful to fail. But it is far sadder when a
storyteller stops wanting to try.

Now I fear that I've told you more than you ever wanted to know about how
Speaker for the Dead came to be. A writer's life is boring indeed. I write
stories about people who take risks, who reach out and change the world. But
when it comes to my life, it mostly consists of hanging around at home, writing
when I have to, playing computer games or watching TV whenever I can get away
with it. My real life is being with my wife, with my children; going to church
and teaching my Sunday school class; keeping in touch with my family and
friends; and, the primary duty of every father, turning off lights throughout
the house and muttering about how I'm the only one who seems to care about
turning them off because I'm the one who has to change the lousy light bulbs. I
doubt that there's much of a story in that.

But I hope that in the lives of Ender Wiggin, Novinha, Miro, Ela, Human, Jane,
the hive queen, and so many others in this book, you will find stories worth
holding in your memory, perhaps even in your heart. That's the transaction that
counts more than bestseller lists, royalty statements, awards, or reviews.
Because in the pages of this book, you and I will meet one-on-one, my mind and
yours, and you will enter a world of my making and dwell there, not as a
character that I control, but as a person with a mind of your own. You will make
of my story what you need it to be, if you can. I hope my tale is true enough
and flexible enough that you can make it into a world worth living in.
